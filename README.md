```sh
serversideup/php:{{version}}-{{variation-name}}
```
For example... If I wanted to run **PHP 8.0** with **FPM + NGINX**, I would use this image:
```sh
serversideup/php:8.0-fpm-nginx
```

### Updates
âœ… The image builds automatically run weekly (Tuesday at 0800 UTC) for latest security updates.

# About this project
We're taking the extra effort to open source as much as we can. Not only could this potentially help someone learn a little bit of Docker, but it makes it a *heck of a lot* easier for us to work with you on new open source ideas.

### Project credits & inspiration

#### [Chris Fidao](https://github.com/fideloper)
Majority of our knowledge came from Chris' course, [Shipping Docker](https://serversforhackers.com/shipping-docker). If you have yet to discover his content, you will be very satisfied with every course he has to offer. He's a great human being and excellent educator.

#### [PHPDocker.io](https://github.com/phpdocker-io/base-images)
This team has an excellent repository and millions of pulls per month. We really like how they structured their code.

# Why these images and not other ones?
Many people have docker images, but they are not runnning them in production. We want to share as much as we can of our production images so we can make it easier to work with you.

We want to make sure that when we work together ***EVERY*** development environment is the same across the board -- no matter how you prefer to work.

# Submitting issues and pull requests
Since there are a lot of dependencies on these images, please understand that it can make it complicated on mergine your pull request.

We'd love to have your help, but it might be best to explain your intentions first before contributing.

### Like we said -- we're always learning
